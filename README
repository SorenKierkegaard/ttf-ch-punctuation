package: ttf-ch-punctuation

Package, when installed, gives access to the CollegeHumour Punctuation
font. The font is buggy, and does not appear to work particularly well
in LibreOffice. AbiWord appears to accept the font relatively well,
although it is only particularly clear at high font-points, such as
36-pt. This is the fault of the .ttf itself, and is not something to 
be reconciled with any distribution of Linux specifically.

Package can be installed by downloading the .tar.gz, extracting,
running makepkg -s, and then pacman -U <filename> as root, where
<filename> is the local .tar.xz.

Font will be installed as "CollegeHumour Punctuation." Have fun!
